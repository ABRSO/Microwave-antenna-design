# Microwave and Antenna Design
This repository contains the **HFSS** designs and **MATLAB** code for all the microwave and antenna design experiments.
High-Frequency Structure Simulaton from Ansys Electronics Desktop Student 2021a is used for the simulations.

**The list of experiments available here : ** 
  1. Design half wave dipole antenna. 
  2. Calculation of transmission line parameters (R, L, C & G) and characteristic impedance (Zo) of a flexible RG58 coaxial cable operating at a frequency of 1GHz. 
  3. Design a microstrip feedline with characteristic impedance (Zo) 50 ohm and calculate the characteristic impedance (Zo) of microstrip line for the obtained feed          width. 
  4. Determine the dimensions (length & width) of a rectangular microstrip patch antenna (RMSA). 
  5. Observe the variations of normalized input impedance with the feed position of a rectangular microstrip patch antenna (RMSA). 
  6. Design Rectangular Microstrip Patch antenna (RMSA) using inset feed technique. Compare its performance with Edge feed. 
  7. Design Rectangular Microstrip Patch antenna (RMSA) using coaxial probe feed. 
  8. Design Rectangular Microstrip Patch antenna (RMSA) using Proximity coupling and Aperture coupling feed techniques. 
  9. Compare the radiation pattern of Uniform array to Binomial array. 

The experiments are available in **Ansys Electronics Desktop Student File (.aedt)** file format.
